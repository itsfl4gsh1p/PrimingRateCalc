PrimingRateCalc
===============

Just a simple script I wrote to calculate volumes of CO2 needed in a homebrew batch. It is not 100%
accurate as it is based a table of values and therefore requires some rounding. Calculations based
on formulas from http://hdb.org/ddraper/priming.html. The Volumes table within the program is based
on information from that site in conjunction with How to Brew by John Palmer. This has been done
many times before I just thought it would be fun to reinvent the wheel.

This mainly being for my own personal entertainment there is no error handling what-so-ever. So please
keep that in mind.
